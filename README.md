# Portfolio v1.0
This was my first portfolio site. 

I used HTML, SASS and JavaScript. It contains descriptions and links of the five projects I've done thus far. But I have migrated the contents, especially the projects, over to my new [Gatsby blog](http://jenlky.com/). There lies projects I have done and blog posts on my experience and lessons learnt from doing tech stuff.

I chose GatsbyJS because 1) it required relatively low startup time, 2) has an awesome clean look and many other starters to choose from, 3) uses graphQL which was something I was interested to try.
